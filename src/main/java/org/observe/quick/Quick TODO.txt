Items left to tackle in Quick

Maybe value-widget.disable-with should take a list of expressions.  This would need to be a new type in ANTLR.
Implement value-tooltip in collection-selector-widgets and tree
More decorations, e.g. font attributes on text widgets

Implement expression types:
	Binary operators
	Unary operators
	...
Implement widget types:
	Combo box
	Spinner
	Slider
	...

Styles.  For example, an external stylesheet (likely a Qonfig file) that determines what color selected items in a tree are.
	See Quick for full details.
